# UBooks

Description:

In this project, we will develop a website that allows clients to sell and purchase used books. Clients will be able to post the books name along with the price and other information. Other clients will be able to purchase the books that they need in a fast and efficient manner.

Usage:

`MAMP` was used to create a local server environment. The following shows how to set up an run the project with MAMP:

First run MAMP and proceed to phpMyAdmin. Next, create a new database named `ubooks` and run the `Create_Tables_Queries.sql` query that is located in the SQL directory of the UBooks project. This query will create the schema and add the test data. Next, in your local directory, move the UBooks directory to the `MAMP\htdocs\` directory. Finally, while the local server is running, open a browser and write `http://localhost/UBooks/`.

TODO:

- Improve layout for user profile.
- Add security features such as sign in validation.
