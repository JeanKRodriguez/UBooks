# UBooks

Description:

In this project, we will develop a website that allows clients to sell and purchase used books. Clients will be able to post the books name along with the price and other information. Other clients will be able to purchase the books that they need in a fast and efficient manner.

Usage:

First set up a local server, such as `MAMP`, and create a database. Next, run the query in the SQL directory. This query will create the schema and add the test data. Finally, while the local server is running run `home.html` script.

TODO:

- Improve layout for user profile.
- Add security features such as sign in validation.
